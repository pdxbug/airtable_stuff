/** Created by Kerry Mraz (kerry.mraz@hearst.com) part of the HNP IT Editorial Team
 * The script is designed to take new records created in the form and included in the 'Dev Table'
 * process for duplicates, combine Digital/Online Channels, create Secondary Publication
 * 
 * De-duplication:
 * At times, multiple users will attempt to submit the same story (slug). This automation will 
 * check to see if the slug was already submitted today (auto slugging will add the day's date
 * so it doesn't work if the users are a day or more apart in submission). If the slug was already
 * created, it will create the story, but append a dash and number (exampleslug-1) to the slug that
 * will signify to the editors that one already exists
 * 
 * Digital/Online Channels:
 * Each community within each newsroom has multiple Digital Channels
 * Individual sorting into separate questions forces separate fields in the table
 * If all Digital Channels were in a single question, users would have to search 
 * for their channel out of hundreds instead of searching through 20-30
 * These fields needed to be combined to a single table in the Budget Table
 * 
 * Secondary/Sister Publications:
 * A user creating a story may wish to have the story appear in other newspapers
 * This happens for Houston and San Antonio for political stories a lot.
 * If the user submits a Secondary Publication, a separate record needs to be created
 * Sister Publications are publications that regularly print stories in both papers
 * and the automation will automatically create the Secondary Publication without user
 * intervention
 * 
 * Keywords:
 * Some publications want to include keywords, this needed to be pushed a separate way 
 * than normal entry, see notes below
 *

/**set the constant variables
* this create the slugTableName 'Budget', slugTempTableName 'Dev Table', slugTablePrimaryFieldName 'Slug',
* it pulls in the record ID and record Name that was just created for quick comparison of values
* sets the debug value false means it will run the slugs into the Budget Table and true means it will only debug
* preventing any records from being created in the Budget Table (very useful for code debugging without creating 
* records that need to be removed later)
